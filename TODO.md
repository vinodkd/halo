The todo list
-------------

- [] Prototype version !4/30/2015!
	- [] start with the end user documentation and slowly bring in working pieces from the plnext source - making them uniform as I go along
		- [] overview
		- [] layer 1: basic data and actions
			- [] nodes
				- [] atomic nodes and primitives
					- [] atomic "names"
					- [] atomic numbers
					- [] strings
					- [] how everything is a string in the language
				- [] compound nodes
					- [] anonymous nodes
					- [] node alias
				- [] node attributes
					- [] nv pairs
					- [] aliases
					- [] tags
			- [] Comments
			- [] implement all of the above.
				- [X] implement existing functionality
				- [] implement new syntax envisioned
			- [] actions: read
				[X] implement read
		- [] layer 2: references, contexts and the run action
			- [] references
				- [] add the reference syntax into the parser
			- [] contexts 
			- [] data in memory.
				- [] nodes list
				- [] edges list
				- [] nodes with in and out edge properties that can be used to traverse the graph.
				- [X] lookup table that maps aliases to nodes
				- [] and more generically, creates hash ids for each node
				- [] create hin and hout contexts and switch all logging to that
			- [] actions: run
				- [] all actions are available in "data format" as well, so that they can be acted on from a written program vs from the command line
				- [X] representing programs as data
					- [X] basic ssi language
					- [] types of strings
						- [] app strings
						- [X] lang strings
						- [X] os/base strings
					- [] represent nodes with some short cuts: 
						- [X] backquoted strings are base strings
						- [X] double quoted strings are evaled, ie understood by the language. 
				- [] representing programs as processes by converting them to memory data
				- [] actions for programs
					- [] run using fizzbuzz
					- [] server as a version of run
					- [] multi-language program: todomvc
		- [] layer 3: prototypes and halo as a documentation language
			- [] prototypes and inheritance
			- [] app strings as heredocs
			- [] incomplete features
				- [] trivially done with ... nodes
			- [] actions: viz
		- [] layer 4: halo as an analysis language
			- [] analyze
		- [] layer 5: incremental data and human actions
			- [] incremental data
				- [] add incremental data to the parser
				- [] show memory model with incremental data
				- [] incremental code
					- [] show mapping from one version of todomvc to another using inheritance.
			- [] versions
				- [] expand the ref syntax to handle versions
			- [] include the human:
				- [] add ask and wait actions to base machine
				- [] demo understanding of todomvc as a series of edit actions
				- [] actions that need a human or mimic a human			
					- [] build
					- [] deploy
		- [] layer 6: meta data and code
			- [] add a logic language in comments and have it interpreted at a higher level
				- [] use prolog/logic language from halo for this
		- [] layer 7: halo as an integration language
			- text ide
			- gui ide
			- integration with sourcegraph
- [] Version 1.0
	- [] rewrite ssi so that sequence would just add a start and stop node to and traverse the memory graph to execute it.
	- [] ports as start and end points in nodes.
