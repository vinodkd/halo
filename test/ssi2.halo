/* 
This is a simple turning machine.
It supports the basic operations required, ie, Sequence, Selection and Iteration.

It does this in the simplest possible way:
- sequence is just a list of steps. no data or variables.
- selection is the only built in "form" - the if node.
- iteration is through edges from the if node to other nodes in the sequence.

		// this shows two steps in the same line
		`ps -ef` `df -h`
		if{
			// condition is evaluated in the base language
			`expr 2 \> 1`
			// edges to other nodes in the sequence
			--> stepD
