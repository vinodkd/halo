/* 
This is a simple turning machine.
It supports the basic operations required, ie, Sequence, Selection and Iteration.

It does this in the simplest possible way:
- sequence is just a list of steps. no data or variables.
- selection is the only built in "form" - the if node.
- iteration is through edges from the if node to other nodes in the sequence.
